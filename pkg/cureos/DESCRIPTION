Description: This package implements several functions useful for
  analyse and use Count/Frequency or Scoring matrices (i.e. PWMs 
  PSSMs) such as used to search for motifs in DNA or Protein sequences, e.g.
  transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Its special focus is to search
  for for Conserved Upstream Regulatory Elements (TFBSs) in Orthologous Sequences.
  It also contains functions to visualize elements summarized in UCSC track format
  (see genome.ucsc.edu) on sequence. It can be used to visualize results of chip-on-chip
  experiments.
